# About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my coding skills. (42 Singapore please accept me)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a good human being. Coding and making Youtube videos and drumming and house renovation things. The usual life things
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making cooking videos. I am not good enough of a coder yet
- 💬 "I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited." -- Sylvia Plath
